              <p>Hello! <br/>
             I'm Jessica Torti. I'm 32 years old. </br>'m from Buenos Aires, Argentina. <br/>I'm married, no children, </br> I have three pets... <br/>Just for fun, you can see them <a href="mypets.html">here</a>.</p>

                 <h3>About my Education</h3>
                    <p> I'm a History and Philosophy Professor. I have studied in University for seven years and then I worked in the University for five years, as a part of a scolarship career average-based which I finished in 2017. At the same time, I was a teacher in high school, where I am still working in. Although it doesn't leave me enough time to study, nonetheless I'm always trying to do my best in my free time in order to gain more experience in this new field.</p> <br/><br/>
                 <h3>Â¿How did I get from Professor to Web Development?</h3>
                    <p>Well... part of my hobbies are playing the piano, phisical exercise, writing, reading (beacuse I am a inveterate reader)... but the thing I enjoy the most -besides Teaching- is Learning. I like to learn about almost anything. But I am particularly interested in Languages. I have been studying several languages, some of them by myself, and others in college.
            I have been learning Ancient Greek and Latin for three years. Then I studied French -only lectocomprehension, I understand just I little bit of the spoken language), German -all the skills, but I would have to review it for practice-.
            I also studied on my own some japanese, russian, portuguese and a modern greek.</p>
            <br/>
            <p> In this context, my husband, who was studying HTML, told me that HTML <b>was</b> a language. So I got interested in. And that is how I get here... I began with HTML, then with CSS, a little bit of JavaScript, all by myself using youtube. Then a friend of mine gave to me a Platzi subscription, wich allowed me to discover that the things I've been learning belonged to a Web Development Software career.
            So, I started to take the courses, and I liked it. Then I realized something amazing to me. 
            JavaScript and the other languages used in web development was more than languages... They allow us to create aplications, interactions with users, give commands to a computer or even to an object like a car or a tv. 
            I have never been in a good relationship with technology, generally speaking, but that was before I began to understand it. Platzi has helped me a lot in that. I have learned how the internet works, and what was the internet, how a computer works, the binary system -another language by the way... I've been absorbed in it for a while haha-. And I have to confess that I like so much the idea or give commands to a computer and obtain an answer, as an outuput that I could control if I understand well how to input the commands.</p>
