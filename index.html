               <h4> More about me </h4>
              Part of my hobbies are playing the piano, phisical exercise, writing, reading, beacuse I am a inveterate reader... but the thing I enjoy the most -besides Teaching- is Learning.
I like to learn about almost anything. bUT i AM PARTICULARLY INTERESTING in LANGUAGES.
I have been studying several languages, some of them by myself, and others in college.
I have been learning Ancient Greek and Latin for thre years. Then I studyied French -only lectocomprehension, I understand just I little bit of the spoken language), German -all the skills, but i would have to review it to practice-.
I also studyied on my own some japanese, russian, portuguese and a modern greek.

<h4>Â¿How did I get from Professor to Web Development?</h4>
In this context, my husband, who was studying html, told me that HTML WAS a language. So I got interested in. And that is how I get here... I began with html, then css, a little bit of javascript, all by myself using youtube. Then a friend of mine, in july of this year, Jose Olguin, give to me a Platzi subscription, wich allows me to discover that the things I've been learning belonged a Webdevelopment software career.
So, I started to take the courses, and I like it.

Then I realized something amazing to me.

JavaScript and the other languages used in web development was more than languages. They allow us to create aplications, interactions with users, give commands to a computer or even to an object like a car or a tv.
I have never been in a good relationship with technology in gral, But that was before i began to study in platzi. I have learned how the internet works, and what was the internet, how a computer works, the binary system -another language by the way... I've been absorbed in it for a while haha-. And I have to confess that I like so much the idea or give commands to a computer and obtain an answer, as outuput that I could control if I understand well how to input the commands.
